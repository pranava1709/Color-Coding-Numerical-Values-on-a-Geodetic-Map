# Color-Coding-and-Visulaizing-Numerical-Values-on-a-Geodetic-Map

In Qgis, I designed a map taking the regions of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Then, converted the KML to ESRI Shape File. Using AvirisNG Data, the regions were identified and extracted Polygon Vector Coordinates for around 7 Regions.

By developing this record, we automated the code by plotting these coordinates taking the generated Map as the main projection representing each numerical value with different colors. The following shows the example of the color plot of Gas Concentration, where we have assumed a dummy column density for each Polygon Vector.
