# Color-Coding-a-False-Color-Composite-for-Visulaizing-Numerical-Values-on-a-Geodetic-Map

In Qgis, I designed a map taking the regions of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Then, we converted the GeoTIFF to ESRI Shape File.Using AvirisNG Data, the regions were identified, and extracted Polygon Vector Coordinates for around 7 Regions.

By developing this record, we automated the code by plotting these coordinates taking the generated Map as the main projective representing each numerical value with different colors.The following shows the example of the color plot of Gas Concentration,where we have assumed a specific concentration for each Polygon Vector.
